    <h2>In the beginning...</h2>
    <p>
      QA Ltd was formed in 1985 by three former Intel employees:
      <strong>Mike Cheeseman, Jim Watt and Howard Kornstein</strong>. The name
      was inspired by a combination of Queen Anne House in Cirencester, the
      company's first offices, and the term 'quality assurance'. The trio soon
      moved into the Cirencester Park Estate, where the Earl Bathurst was their
      landlord.
